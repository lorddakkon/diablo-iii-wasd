Welcome to the Diablo III WASD project! The goal of this project is to provide alternative movement functions in Diablo III through various means.

I want to draw your attention to this just to make you aware that currently these scripts are not given the green light. On the contrary, it would seem Bashiok says they will not allow  WASD. Use the scripts at your own risk. I don't want anyone falsely thinking these are okay to use. Just a word of warning.

# Updates #

05/27/12 - Blizzard's startup process for D3 seems to have changed. A few users brought this to my attention when they emailed me that the script is no longer working and wanting to know if it was patched out by Blizz. This is not the case and the scripts work just fine still. The problem is that the startup process has been altered and a section of the script that used to auto-terminate when the game was no longer active and also close agent.exe (since it used to not close when the game did) is now closing the script prematurely if you start the script before starting Diablo 3. The simple solution for the time being is to start the game first then tab out once it you are either at the login screen or in a game and start the script. It will continue to run correctly from that point. I will be removing the auto-close portion of the script and posting up copies soon that you won't need to load the game first to be able to run. Thanks for all your help to those sending me feedback and praise. Your thoughts and ideas are appreciated.

05/23/12 - Recently I have taken on a new contributer to the project. He has been working on a MAC OSX version of WASD and has just released his initial version. Now MAC users can enjoy WASD in D3 as well. If you own a MAC and play Diablo on it you may want to give his app a try. You can find it in the downloads section. I have also released a new version of the 360 script to try an address an issue brought to me by a user. The new version also includes the default button numbers for the controller in the config section so users can easily edit the button layout for their skills. Enjoy!

05/22/12 - A user made a new video for my WASD script. It is linked below in the Videos section. Check it out!

05/19/12 - It has been brought to my attention that the scripts do not work on the final phase of the Belial fight. For the time being, please just revert to keyboard/mouse for that one particular fight. I am thinking up a solution to the problem. Perspective changes break the script (zooming as another user brought up to me) and eventually I might have a working solution. Just wanted to put this out there so people know ahead of time.

# Current Scripts #
Currently I have released one script that enables WASD-style movement (originally written by Ever1ast) and one that allows the analog stick of the Logitech G13 to control movement within the Diablo 3 game client.

Check the downloads section above for the scripts.

# Wiki Info #
The Wiki includes some information pages to support, configuration, and troubleshooting and will be expanded as needed and is possible.

# Videos #

Here is a demo and instructional video on using the script made by a user:

It is much better done then anything I produce as my video making experience is rather minuscule. Enjoy and thanks to DudesCast for taking the time to do this and ask for my permission to make it public!

This project is entirely opensource so I encourage all users to do whatever they want with the scripts and that includes videos like the one above. Credit is nice where it is due, but not required. If I see something produced using my scripts and I link to it on the project site I will certainly give the proper props.


Enjoy the scripts!

# How you can contribute to the Project #
If you would like to contribute to the project feel free send an email request to jsigley@gmail.com. I will add you as a Contributer. This doesn't immediately give you any extra privileges, but it can be a considered a show of support for the project. If you actually want to help write the Wiki page, contribute tweaks to the scripts, or help in some other way we can discuss exactly what it is by email and I can figure out rights for you from there.

Alternatively if you just want to ask questions and talk about the scripts, I have set up two Google Discussion groups. There is one for each major script released currently and you can find the links for them at the bottom left of this page. Feel free to join a group and ask away. Any kind of discussion about the scripts or the project is welcome in those groups so feel free to show your support, offer your help, ask for it, or make any suggestions of what you would like to see from the project.
